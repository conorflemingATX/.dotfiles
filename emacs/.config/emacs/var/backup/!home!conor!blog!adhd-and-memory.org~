#+title: ADHD and Memory
#+date: 02/08/21

I can never remember anything that has ever happened to me that wasn't like the last thing that I thought. I wouldn't have a life story if I didn't sit down write it and really figure it out on paper. Otherwise I would never know what has ever happened to me. It's a real problem in therapy when I can't remember anything that has ever happened to me, or anything that I have ever thought before the session. I don't think I would recognize anyone in my group if I ever saw them on the street.
